Day 1 -> Historian Hysteria
Steps to solve this problem are following:
  I...
  1. Sorted LEFT LIST with selectionsort algorithm
  2. Sorted RIGHT LIST with selectionsort algorithm
  3. Found the distance between numbers whose indexs are same in both lists
   For example, left_list[0] - right_list[0] and so on
  4. Added the results of distances to new list
  5. Found the sum of that new list and got result


Code:
def findsmallest(arr):
  smallest = arr[0]
  smallest_index = 0
  for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    if arr[i] < smallest:
      smallest = arr[i]
      smallest_index = i
  
  return smallest_index
  

def selectionsort(arr):
  newArr = []
  for i in range(len(arr)):
    smallest = findsmallest(arr)
    newArr.append(arr.pop(smallest))
  
  return newArr

left_nums = []
right_nums = []
distances = []  
  
for i in range(1000):
  a,b = map(int,input().split())
  left_nums.append(a)
  right_nums.append(b)

left_nums_sorted = selectionsort(left_nums)
right_nums_sorted = selectionsort(right_nums)

for i in range(1000):
  x = abs(left_nums_sorted[i]-right_nums_sorted[i])
  distances.append(x)

print(sum(distances))
